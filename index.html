            <p>Murders, debt collection, selling information, those were classified as both business and hobby to the residents of the crime-ridden isle.</p>

            <p>A one line note between the lines of her well used notepad.</p>
            <p>The young reporter had 3 days to find the stolen gem before the consequence of the theft would send her client to a place worse than Hell.</p>
            <p>However, one wrong move while collecting clues and gathering intel, and Natasha will find herself in the same place.</p>
            <p>Will the ruby and the culprit be found? Or does only death await?</p>
